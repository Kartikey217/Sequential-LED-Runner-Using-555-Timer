# Sequential LED Runner Using 555 Timer

This project showcases a PCB-based sequential LED runner built using the 555 timer IC. The 555 is configured in astable mode to generate continuous pulses, which drive LEDs in a predefined order to create a smooth running-light effect. 
The PCB layout ensures neat routing, stable operation, and reliable LED switching.

Note: The circuit is designed and implemented on PCB but has not been simulated yet.

# Features
1. 555 timer in astable mode
2. Sequential LED ON/OFF pattern
3. Running-light (LED chaser) effect
4. Clean and compact PCB layout
5. Beginner-friendly electronics project

# How It Works
1. The 555 timer generates continuous pulses
2. These pulses are fed to a sequencing stage (counter/logic or discrete design)
3. LEDs turn ON and OFF one after another, following the pulse timing
4. The PCB ensures consistent operation without loose connections

# Applications
1. LED chaser circuits
2. Timing and sequencing experiments
3. Hobby electronics
4. Educational demonstrations

# Future Improvements
- Add simulation
- Adjustable speed control (potentiometer)
- Microcontroller-based programmable patterns
